## **Features**
1. **Threat Data Collection**
   - Fetches indicators of compromise (IoCs) such as IPs, CVEs, domains, and file hashes using the AlienVault OTX API.
   - Stores threat data in a structured JSON format for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Highlights high-risk CVEs based on descriptions, CVSS scores, or specific keywords.
   - Counts and categorizes threat indicators by type to reveal trends and patterns.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Generates pie charts and bar graphs to visualize the distribution of threats.
   - Clear, legend-based visual representation for enhanced clarity.

4. **Scalable Design**
   - Built with modular Python scripts to facilitate enhancements like:
     - Machine learning-based threat classification.
     - Zero-day vulnerability updates when new reports are provided.
     - Cloud deployment for real-time scalability.
